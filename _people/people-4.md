My name is Markie Venturini, and I am a 2nd year senior in the speech, language and hearing sciences program. I am interested in pursuing a career in speech-language pathology. I would like to work with populations diagnosed with neurogenic communication disorders. I enjoy going for walks at natural preserves and spending time with my friends and family.
