My name is Keanna Thornton. My family known nickname is Keke. I’m a senior finishing up my last semester at Western Michigan. I’m an Interdisciplinary Health Services major with a focus in physical therapy. My career goal is to become a physical therapist. Before I reach this goal, I have to complete an additional three years of schooling at a Doctorate of Physical Therapy program. On the other hand, some of my hobbies are singing, dancing, writing music or poetry, and doing makeup.
