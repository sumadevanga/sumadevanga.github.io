My name is Bao Yang. I am a senior undergraduate student in the Interdisciplinary Health Services (IHS) program at Western Michigan University with a minor in Holistic Health & Wellness. My career goal is to become a Physician Assistant with a focus in Obstetrics and Gynecology. In my free time, I like to cook and exercise to maintain my overall health.
