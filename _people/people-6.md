My name is Katie Giustino! I am an undergraduate junior studying speech, language, and hearing sciences and minoring in American Sign Language and psychology. This is my fourth semester being in the NCI lab. Regarding my career interests, they are still quite broad at the moment as I am still learning the field as a whole; all I know is I am very interested in pediatric treatment.
