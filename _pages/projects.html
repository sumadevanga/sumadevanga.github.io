	<h2>The Referencing Game:</h2>
	<p>Word finding or naming deficits are a hallmark of aphasia that persists in the chronic phase of recovery. We are drawing on distributed theories of communication that conceptualize communication as a creative and emergent accomplishment and theorize referencing (naming and pointing to things, ideas, people, and so on) as a collaborative process speakers and listeners must engage in together within specific interactions (e.g., Clark, 1992; Hanks, 1990). We have designed the collaborative referencing game as a clinical intervention situated within a rich communicative environment. Using the distributed perspective, we are studying the effects of the collaborative referencing intervention on participants’ communication, participation and confidence.</p>

	<h2>Stories of Aphasia: Paths to Recovery in India</h2>
	<p>Using ethnographic methods and narrative analysis, the goal of our study is to: <em>Explore paths to recovery from aphasia for people in India through detailed case studies of persons with aphasia  (PWA)& their routine communication partners (family, friends, co-workers)</em><br><br>
	Embedded in ethnographic traditions, this work will also provide an interpretive frame that can be used to (re)examine the rehabilitation practices in other parts of the world—including the US.</p>
